# COSC314Fibonacci
I believe that the recursive approach of doing this project is better. The advantage of recurion is that it is faster and in this case uses much less lines of code.
The advantage to iteration is that it is a lot more stable and can be more flexible to adding parts. Going forward I see myself using more iterative approaches when coding.
